Step 1: Load and Visualize Dataset

    Loading the dataset: The Iris dataset is used here, which contains features about different species of flowers (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).

    PCA for 2D view: PCA (Principal Component Analysis) reduces the dataset to two dimensions to make it easier to visualize. This is optional but helps when you want to view data in a 2D scatter plot.

Step 2: Fit K-Means and Assign Cluster Labels

    K-Means clustering: K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to group the data into clusters. We set n_clusters=3, meaning we want to divide the data into 3 groups.

    Assigning cluster labels: The algorithm assigns each data point to one of the clusters.

Step 3: Use Elbow Method to Find Optimal K

    Elbow Method: The Elbow Method helps to choose the best number of clusters (K). The idea is to run the K-Means algorithm for different values of K (from 1 to 10 here) and plot the inertia (within-cluster sum of squared distances). The point where the inertia starts to decrease more slowly is considered the "elbow," and thatâ€™s a good choice for K.

Step 4: Visualize Clusters with Color-Coding

    2D visualization: After performing PCA to reduce the dimensions, we plot the data points in 2D and color them according to their assigned cluster labels. This helps visually confirm how well the algorithm grouped the data.

Step 5: Evaluate Clustering using Silhouette Score

    Silhouette Score: This is a measure of how well-separated the clusters are. A higher score indicates that the points are well clustered, and a lower score suggests that some points may be misclassified. The score ranges from -1 to 1, where a higher value means better clustering.
